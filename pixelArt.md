# PixelArt

I want to develop games and create the surrounding worlds. Therefore, I need a way to visualize the stories I want to tell in my games.
I tried different art styles, but pixel art seems to fit my natural talents the most.
After a while, I discovered a tool named Aseprite and recently started to create my first sprites and small animations.

Here you can see the first steps I took on my way to become a pixel artist.
