# Light Arena

I had an idea. Well, that's how game development usually starts.

My idea is, having an arena with a limited number of platforms, moving up and down in certain patterns.
Players should now fight each other 1vs1 or 2vs2 in this arena to achieve different goals,
like "capture the flag", "king of the hill", or whatever game mode would feel great to play in this arena.
I thought of a shooter component to bring some action to the game and maybe some coop features to make it a bit more interesting for team players.
The project name is "Light Arena" for now, it's not the final title anyway.

First off, I wanted to get some inspiration. A mood board would give me a proper orientation, of how the game should look and feel.

The left one is actually from an Audi commercial, but the artworks were created by Lee Davies and Ryan Hawthorne.

As I just learned about a game engine called Godot, which  seemed to be ideal for indie developers, I decided to give it a try.
So, I created this arena and some different kinds of platform patterns in Godot. I got the prototype done and I am pretty satisfied with it until now.

I then started to create some 3D-models for a prototype of a character model in blender, to get a feeling of how this game could look like.<br>

I quickly learned, that creating assets and models takes a lot of time, so I just got to create these models, before I decided that this was a task for future-me.
<br><br>
And here I am now, considering to pick up working on this ambitious project again. Co-workers are welcome :)
