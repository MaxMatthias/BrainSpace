#Light Arena

I had an idea. Well, that's how game development usually starts.

My idea is, having an arena with a limited number of platforms, moving up and down in certain patterns.
Players should now fight each other 1vs1 or 2vs2 in this arena to achieve different goals,
like "capture the flag", "king of the hill", or whatever game mode would feel great to play in this arena.
I thought of a shooter component to bring some action to the game and maybe some coop features to make it a bit more interesting for team players.

First off, I wanted to get some inspiration. A mood board would give me a proper orientation, of how the game should look and feel.



So, I created this arena and some different kinds of platform patterns. I also started to create some 3D-models for a prototype of a character model, to get a feeling of how this game could look like.
